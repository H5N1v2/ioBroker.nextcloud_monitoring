# nextcloud-monitoring adapter for ioBroker

---
## ⚠️ Important Note: Naming Convention Change (v1.1.2+)

> **ATTENTION:** Due to official ioBroker naming guidelines, this adapter has been renamed from `nextcloud_monitoring` (underscore) to **`nextcloud-monitoring`** (dash).

**What does this mean for you?**
* **No automatic updates:** If you are using version 1.1.1 or older, you will no longer receive updates through the old package name.
* **Reinstallation required:** Please uninstall the old version (`nextcloud_monitoring`) and install the new version (`nextcloud-monitoring`) via the ioBroker repository or GitHub.
* **Settings:** You will need to re-enter your instance configuration once in the new version.

We apologize for the inconvenience, but this change was necessary to comply with official ioBroker repository standards.
---

## Description
This adapter allows for detailed monitoring of your Nextcloud instance via the official OCS API (`serverinfo`). It provides numerous system data, user statistics, shares, as well as performance values from PHP (OPcache/FPM) and the database directly in ioBroker.

## Features
* **System Status:** CPU load, RAM usage, free disk space, and Nextcloud version.
* **User Statistics:** Number of active users (5 min, 1 hr, 24 hr), total number of files, and storage usage.
* **Shares:** Monitoring of link shares, Talk rooms, and federated shares.
* **Server Health:** PHP version, memory limit, OPcache hit rate, and detailed FPM process statistics.

---

## Installation & Configuration

### 1. Connection Settings
* **Domain:** Enter your Nextcloud domain without `https://` (e.g., `cloud.yourdomain.com`).
* **Token:** The OCS API token of your Nextcloud (see section "How-To: Token").
* **Update Interval:** Time in minutes between API requests (Default: 10 min, Minimum: 5 min).
* **Multible Server:** You can now add multible Server e.g.: my_server_1, and next server e.g.: other_server_2

### 2. Data Options
* **Skip Apps:** Disables the detailed list of installed apps to reduce API load.
* **Skip Update Check:** Disables checking for new Nextcloud versions.

# How-To: Create & Set Token

Accessing the `serverinfo` API requires a valid API token. This token must be stored directly in the Nextcloud configuration.

### Generate the Token (Linux / Windows)
To enable access, you must generate a token (a random string) and register it in your Nextcloud instance using the `occ` tool.

**Command to generate the token:**
* **Linux (Terminal):** 

`openssl rand -hex 32`
* **Windows (PowerShell):** 

`$bytes = New-Object Byte[] 32; (New-Object System.Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider).GetBytes($bytes); [System.BitConverter]::ToString($bytes).Replace("-", "").ToLower()`

* Alternatively, you can use online tools such as 

[it-tools.tech/token-generator](https://it-tools.tech/token-generator).*

# Set Token in Nextcloud
**Example for Linux (Standard path) in Terminal:**
```bash
sudo -u www-data php /var/www/nextcloud/occ config:app:set serverinfo token --value YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN
```
Command for Windows (PowerShell/CMD): Navigate to your Nextcloud directory and execute:

`php occ config:app:set serverinfo token --value YOUR_GENERATED_TOKEN`

Monitored Data Points (Excerpt)

| Path | Description | Data Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `system.version` | Installed Nextcloud version | string |
| `system.cpuload_1` | CPU load of the last minute | number |
| `system.freespace` | Free disk space | string |
| `storage.num_users` | Total number of users | number |
| `server.php.opcache_hit_rate` | Efficiency of the PHP cache | string |
| `fpm.active_processes` | Active PHP-FPM processes | number |
| `activeUsers.last5min` | Users active in the last 5 minutes | number |

# Troubleshooting (FAQ)

### Invalid Domain: Enter the domain without a protocol.

    Correct: mycloud.com or mycloud.com/folder

    Incorrect: https://mycloud.com or http://mycloud.com/folder

### API delivers no data:

Ensure that the "Server Info" app (standard app) is enabled in your Nextcloud under "Apps". Without this app, the adapter cannot retrieve any data.

### Token Error:

Verify if the token was correctly saved in Nextcloud using:

`occ cofig:app:get serverinfo token`

### Maintenance Mode:

If your Nextcloud is in maintenance mode, the adapter will not be able to fetch data and will log an error. This is normal behavior as the API is disabled during maintenance.
